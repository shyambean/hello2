    <h1>😀History of Rapha IT</h1>
    <div>
        * <mark>Rapha IT </mark>is a Hebrew word which means "to heal" or "to correct". <br>
        * James Park had dreamed a better Nepal and a better world through IT works for long time.<br>
        * He has deeply concerned that young people of Nepal were leaving the country 
        to earn money abroad and not returning. Without young people working for Nepal, the 
        country has nofuture. He believes the solution was to train them with IT and turn them 
        into professionals who could earn as much as they would abroad while wprking within Nepal. 
        This way not only would the individuals while working within Nepal.<br>
        * With support from KFHI, he secured funding and after many years of trial and error 
        eventually founded what is now Rapha IT.
